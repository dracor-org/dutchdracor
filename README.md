# DutchDraCor
##Corpus Description

This is the Dutch Drama Corpus (DutchDraCor), a collection of [TEI P5](https://tei-c.org/guidelines/p5/)-encoded Dutch-language plays from 1600 to 1800. The corpus is released under the Creative Commons Zero copyright waiver ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)).

The corpus is edited and maintained by Lucas van der Deijl (University of Groningen). Willem Jan Faber (The National Library of the Netherlands) 
designed and coded the workflow used to automatically convert a significant part of the corpus. It consists of fully encoded xml-documents based on digital theatre editions (in .xml or .txt) from the Digitale Bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse Letteren 
([DBNL]) (https://www.dbnl.org/)) and the Census Nederlands Toneel ([Ceneton] (https://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/Dutch/Ceneton/)), edited by Ton Harmsen.
Each play was converted semi-automatically to DraCor-TEI, annotated manually by students from the University of Groningen (see the contributors below) and checked by Lucas van der Deijl. 
DutchDraCor was launched in April 2024 with a first selection of 100 plays, mostly from the seventeenth century. The corpus will continue to grow, with a focus on early modern material (1550-1800).
